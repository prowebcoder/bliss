When homeostasis is not working its best, or if negative symptoms persist due to illness, injury, or disease, homeostasis support may help.<br/><br/>The physiological advantages of forest exposure are well documented across diverse scientific disciplines. Research indicates that the forest atmosphere contains volatile aerosols emitted by plants, which function as therapeutic agents. BlissThera® is a clinically engineered therapeutic platform that integrates the principles of Forest Medicine with the precision delivery of phytochemicals working in synergy to support multisystemic homeostasis. Theses therapies are administered either chair-side in clinic, or through personal use of the BlissThera® & Mindscape® portable products.</p>",
